# Mogee.nvim

## Introduction

This is my personal neovim configuration. It was built from [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
My other neovim configuration is by [LazyVim by Folke](https://www.lazyvim.org/), whereas in this configuration everything is done from scratch for more control over my configuration. 

Alot of keymaps, plugins and functionality are inspired by [LazyVim by Folke](https://www.lazyvim.org/), this video guide by [DevAsLife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFHlfbKVi30), and this video playlist by [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn).
